# Bitcoin-Fallout-Simulator

This is an immersive 3D FPS survival game built with Unity Game Engine, featuring intense combat across diverse terrains like deserts, forests, and dungeons. 
Players strategically manage health, experience points, and upgrades to survive enemy waves and environmental hazards triggered by cryptocurrency overmining. 

# Game Features
Implemented dynamic gameplay mechanics including laser and card-based weapon systems, enemy AI with patrol and attack states, enjoyable background music and SFXs, and intuitive UI/UX for upgrades and game progression. Wrote 16 Different C# scripts, to handle complex mechanics like dynamic enemy AI, enabling patrols, chasing behaviors, and strategic attack patterns using Unity's NavMesh system. Additionally, other features include sophisticated player interactions such as health management, experience accumulation, and customizable upgrades through intuitive in-game menus and real-time HUD updates. 

I do not claim ownership of the additional resources such as character sprites, music, sound effect, etc present in this game.

# Who made this game?
